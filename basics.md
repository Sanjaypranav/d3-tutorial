D3 stands for Data-Driven Documents. D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3.js is a dynamic, interactive, online data visualizations framework used in a large number of websites. D3.js is written by Mike Bostock, created as a successor to an earlier visualization toolkit called Protovis. This tutorial will give you a complete knowledge on D3.jsframework. This is an introductory tutorial, which covers the basics of Data-Driven Documents and explains how to deal with its various components and sub-components.

Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. The primary goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and efficiently via statistical graphics, plots and information graphics.

Data visualization helps us to communicate our insights quickly and effectively. Any type of data, which is represented by a visualization allows users to compare the data, generate analytic reports, understand patterns and thus helps them to take the decision. Data visualizations can be interactive, so that users analyze specific data in the chart. Well, Data visualizations can be developed and integrated in regular websites and even mobile applications using different JavaScript frameworks.

## What is D3.js?
D3.js is a JavaScript library used to create interactive visualizations in the browser. The D3.js library allows us to manipulate elements of a webpage in the context of a data set. These elements can be HTML, SVG, or Canvas elements and can be introduced, removed, or edited according to the contents of the data set. It is a library for manipulating the DOM objects. D3.js can be a valuable aid in data exploration, it gives you control over your data's representation and lets you add interactivity.

## Why Do We Need D3.js?
D3.js is one of the premier framework when compare to other libraries. This is because it works on the web and its data visualizations are par excellence. Another reason it has worked so well is owing to its flexibility. Since it works seamlessly with the existing web technologies and can manipulate any part of the document object model, it is as flexible as the Client Side Web Technology Stack (HTML, CSS, and SVG). It has a great community support and is easier to learn.

## Features of D3.js
D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
